Codebase Overview for Portfolio Project
========================================

1. **Project Structure**
   - `src/`: Contains all the source code for the application.
     - `App.tsx`: The main React component that serves as the entry point for the app.
     - `assets/`: Contains static assets like images (e.g., profile picture).
     - `lib/`: Contains utility files, such as the Supabase configuration.
     - `App.css`: Contains global styles for the application.
   - `public/`: Contains static files that are directly served (e.g., favicon, index.html).
   - `dist/`: The build output folder generated after running `npm run build`.

2. **Key Features**
   - **React Components**: The app is built using React functional components.
   - **State Management**: Uses React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for managing state and side effects.
   - **Supabase Integration**: Connects to Supabase for backend services like database and authentication.
   - **Responsive Design**: The app is styled to work on various screen sizes.

3. **How It Works**
   - The `App.tsx` file initializes the app and manages the state for the contact form and testimonials.
   - Static assets like the profile image are imported and displayed dynamically.
   - The contact form collects user input and sends it to the backend (via Supabase).
   - Testimonials are displayed in a carousel format, with navigation buttons to switch between them.

4. **How to Run the Project**
   - Install dependencies: `npm install`
   - Start the development server: `npm run dev`
   - Build for production: `npm run build`

5. **Environment Variables**
   - The app uses environment variables for Supabase configuration:
     - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
     - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - These should be set in a `.env` file for local development and in Netlify for deployment.

6. **Deployment**
   - The app is deployed on Netlify. The `dist/` folder is used as the publish directory.

7. **Future Improvements**
   - Add animations for smoother transitions.
   - Optimize images for faster loading.
   - Implement dark mode for better user experience.
